_host_ could be anything it could be your local PC it could a server up in the cloud and whatever it is it's a piece of Hardware, what happens is we take little pieces of each of these pieces of hardware (CPU, memory, I/O - hard-drive) and separate them out into a separate machine this is a _virtual machine_.
then we take these pieces of hardware and in this virtual machine we actually run a full entire operating system.
this technique is commonly used in the cloud if you're deploying something to AWS or ec2 typically what you're doing is you're spinning up a new virtual machine that you can then deploy your code onto.
