when speaking about inborn skills, it's hard to say if someone was born like that or train hardly himself to improve his capabilities. Sometime seeing good sports person or musician that can't do what a child can, could be the possibility that innate gifts are real or maybe not.

innate gifts can be classified in different ways, because, even if their origin comes always from genetics, sometime are very unique. For example a child that can see into darkness or a guy that can use his body as a magnet. Training and hard work cannot reach that level, no metter how hard you are going to put yourself into those kind of skills are impossible to achieve.
