# Routes

## Synchronous and asynchronous handlers

In this example, we are simulating two async calls to a readDb function. As you can imagine, adding more and more asynchronous I/O such as files read or database accesses could make the source quickly unreadable, with the danger of falling into callback hell (you can read more about this at http://callbackhell.com/).

You can rewrite the previous example, using the second syntax to define a route handler, with an async function:

```js
async function asyncHandler(request, reply) {
	const data1 = await readDb();
	const data2 = await readDb();
	return `read from db ${data1} and ${data2}`;
}
```

## Reply is a Promise

In an async function handler, it is highly discouraged to call reply.send() to send a response back to the client. Use _return_ keyword

## How to reply with errors

Generally, in Fastify, an error can be sent when the handler function is sync or thrown when the handler is async. Letâ€™s put this into practice:

```js
function syncHandler(request, reply) {
	const myErr = new Error("this is a 500 error");
	reply.send(myErr); // [1]
}

async function ayncHandler(request, reply) {
	const myErr = new Error("this is a 500 error");
	throw myErr; // [2]
}

async function ayncHandlerCatched(request, reply) {
	try {
		await ayncHandler(request, reply);
	} catch (err) {
		// [3]
		this.log.error(err);
		reply.status(200);
		return { success: false };
	}
}
```

As you can see, at first sight, the differences are minimal: in [1], the send method accepts a Node.js Error object with a custom message. The [2] example is quite similar, but we are throwing the error. The [3] example shows how you can manage your errors with a try/catch block and choose to reply with a 200 HTTP success in any case!

## The error handler 
is a function that is executed whenever an Error object or a JSON is thrown or sent; this means that the error handler is the same regardless of the implementation of the route.
