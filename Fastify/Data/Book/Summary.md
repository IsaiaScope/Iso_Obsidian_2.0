# Summary

## Best Practice

- No CallBack, Async code prefered

---

## Errors

- When you cough an Error, Fastify is unaware that an error has been caught in your handler. In this case, you must set the HTTP response status code; otherwise, it will be 200 â€“ Success by default.

---

## Routes

- _onRoute_ application hook, which listens for every route registered in the app context (and its children contexts). It can mutate the routeOptions object before Fastify instantiates the route endpoint.
