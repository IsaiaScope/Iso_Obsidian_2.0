# Theory

- _Repository_
  - A Git "Repo" is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder. Anytime we want to use Git with a project, app, etc we need to create a new git repository. We can have as many repos on our machine as needed, all with separate histories and contents
- _Committing_
  - Making a commit is similar to making a save in a video game. We're taking a snapshot of a git repository in time. When saving a file, we are saving the state of a single file. With Git, we can save the state of multiple files and folders together
