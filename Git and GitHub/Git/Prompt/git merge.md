# git merge

- Branching makes it super easy to work within self- contained contexts, but often we want to incorporate changes from one branch into another!
- We can do this using the `git merge` command

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

## Merging Made Easy

Remember these two merging concepts:

- We merge branches, not specific commits
- We always merge to the current HEAD branch

To merge, follow these basic steps:

- Switch to or checkout the branch you want to merge the changes into (the receiving branch)
- Use the git merge command to merge changes from a specific branch into the current branch.

Remember, branches are just defined by a branch pointer
```bash
