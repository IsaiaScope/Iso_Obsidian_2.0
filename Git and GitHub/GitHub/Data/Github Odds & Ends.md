# GitHub Odds & Ends

## Public Vs. Private Repos

- _Public repos_ are accessible to everyone on the internet. Anyone can see the repo on Github
- _Private repos_ are only accessible to the owner and people who have been granted access.

## READMEs

A README file is used to communicate important information about a repository including:

- What the project does
- How to run the project
- Why it's noteworthy
- Who maintains the project

_If you put a README in the root of your project, GitHub will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page_

READMEs are Markdown files, ending with the .md extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. It's easy to pick up!
