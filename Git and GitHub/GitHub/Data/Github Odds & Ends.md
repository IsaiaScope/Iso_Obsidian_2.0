# GitHub Odds & Ends

## Public Vs. Private Repos

- _Public repos_ are accessible to everyone on the internet. Anyone can see the repo on Github
- _Private repos_ are only accessible to the owner and people who have been granted access.

## READMEs

A README file is used to communicate important information about a repository including:

- What the project does
- How to run the project
- Why it's noteworthy
- Who maintains the project

_If you put a README in the root of your project, GitHub will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page_

READMEs are Markdown files, ending with the .md extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. It's easy to pick up!

## GitHub Gists

Github Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical Github repository.

## GitHub Pages

Github Pages is a hosting service for static webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS!

_User Site_
You get one user site per Github account. This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website. The default url is based on your Github username, following this pattern: username.github.io though you can change this!

_Project Sites_
You get unlimited project sites! Each Github repo can have a corresponding hosted website. It's as simple as telling Github which specific branch contains the web content. The default urls follow this pattern: username.github.io/repo-name
