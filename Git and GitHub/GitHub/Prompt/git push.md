# git push

if we have a remote set up, let's push some work up to Github! To do this, we need to use the `git push` command

We need to specify the remote we want to push up to AND the specific local branch we want to push up to that remote

- [[Origin (Remote default Name)]]

```bash
git push <remote> <branch>
```

---

- git push origin master tells git to push up the master branch to our origin remote.

```bash
git push <remote> master
```
