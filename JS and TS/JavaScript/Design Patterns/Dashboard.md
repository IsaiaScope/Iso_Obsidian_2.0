# Design Pattern

Design patterns are common architectural approaches to solve common problems

## SOLID Design Principles

Frequently references in Design Pattern literature

| Principles                        | Description                                                                |                        Link                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| _Single Responsibility Principle_ | A class should only have one reason to change                              | [[Single Responsibility Principle \| :SiSolidity:]] |
| _Open-Closed Principle_           | Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification           |      [[Open-Closed Principle \| :SiSolidity:]]      |
| _Liskov Substitution Principle_   | You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype                 |  [[Liskov Substitution Principle \| :SiSolidity:]]  |
| _Interface Segregation Principle_ | Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces       | [[Interface Segregation Principle \| :SiSolidity:]] |
| _Dependency Inversion Principle_  | High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions | [[Dependency Inversion Principle \| :SiSolidity:]]  |
