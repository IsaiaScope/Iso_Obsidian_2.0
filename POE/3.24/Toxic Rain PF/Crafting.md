few _Shrieking Dread Essence_ (+2 to level of socketed bow gems) until open suffix
Open suffix for _Attack speed_ (11%-13%)

### Mid Budget

6 _Porcupine_ divination card
spam _Shrieking Dread Essence_ (+2 to level of socketed bow gems) until hit _Attack speed_
Open suffix (_#% to Damage over Time Multiplier_) or Prefix (_#% increased Damage over Time_)

### End Budget (~10/12 Div)

- [ ] Thicket/Short/Grove Bow _Lvl 78_ (for _#% increased Chaos Damage over Time_ from Hunter Modifier) and 78 is better than higher one because filter out a lot high modifiers that we don't want

- [ ] If already six linked remember to split the bow
- [ ] _Alteration_ spam for tier-1 _attack speed_ with nothing else, we need attack speed alone on the item so _regal orb_ the item and with _orb of annul_ or meta crafting remove useless modifier
- [ ] Bench craft _CAN HAVE UP TO 3 CRAFTED MODIFIERS_ + _CANNOT ROLL ATTACK MODIFIERS_ + Suffix are full and slam an _exalted orb_ for _+1 level of socketed gems_
