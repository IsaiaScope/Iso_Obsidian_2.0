## Best Practice

- _No put rank one into jail because is gonna lose his job, put in jail rank 2/3 for increase safehouse intelligence_
- _Execute low rank characters to rank them up_
- Yellow lines connection means they work together on the same job and nothing else
- Rivals (red lines) means that are rival and is more likely that are gonna trying killing other out joining the fight
- Trusted (green lines) means that are trusted and is more likely that are gonna help each other out joining the fight
- _Practically red lines & green lines are good because make more people spawn_  so DO NOT REMOVE RIVALS/TRUSTED
