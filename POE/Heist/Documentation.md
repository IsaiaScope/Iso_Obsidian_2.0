## Rogue's NPS

### Unlocking Rogues

The player begins with three rogues: Tibbs, Karst, and Isla. The rest of the Rogues are acquired over time as an unlocked Rogue will introduce the player to a new rogue during a Heist. Players simply need to perform regular Heist Contracts and Rogues will unlock occasionally, on their own. New rogues are introduced in the following sequence:

- Tibbs → Tullina → Nenet
- Karst → Huck → Niles → Vinderi → Gianna
- Isla does not introduce any new rogues.

### Roles

Each rouge has a special ability and improve in capabilities leveling up and with equipment
