## Introduction - What is [CDN](https://www.gumlet.com/learn/what-is-video-cdn/?

A Content Delivery Network (`CDN`) is a geographically distributed network of servers that works to speed up the delivery of internet content. Imagine a CDN like a giant storage network for websites, with outposts all over the world.

For example, think about a popular video streaming service like Netflix. When you hit play on a movie, the data for that movie isn't necessarily coming from Netflix's headquarters. Instead, a CDN might store a copy of the movie on a server closer to you. This way, the data doesn't have to travel as far, resulting in a faster and smoother playback experience.

## The Purpose of [Codecs](https://cloudinary.com/glossary/codecs)

A codec is used to compress and decompress data. It can reduce the size of files, which is useful for sending files over the internet or storing them on your computer.Â Typically, a codec consists of two parts: an encoder that compresses the media file and a decoder that decompresses the file. This two-part structure is essential for the efficient processing of multimedia.

Codecs are also responsible for encoding analog video signals into digital form and decoding them back into analog. This process converts images shot by a video camera into pixels that can be displayed on a monitor or other device that uses pixels (like a smartphone).
