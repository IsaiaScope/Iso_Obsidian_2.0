- [DOC](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)
- [[Build.pdf]]

Build by expo `managed` provide a good solution for building apps but less configurable, then `bare` configuration, get creating a new project as `minimal` template. then again is possible to build app without expo but is more expensive and complex
