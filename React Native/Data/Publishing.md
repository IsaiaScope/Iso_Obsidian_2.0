# Publishing

- [DOC](https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/)
  - `eas.json` is the configuration file for EAS CLI and services, where create a preview build for test your app before publishing
- [[Publishing.pdf]]

Build by expo `managed` provide a good solution for building apps but less configurable, then `bare` configuration, get creating a new project as `minimal` template. then again is possible to build app without expo but is more expensive and complex
