- [Class component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component) => no more necessari after React v16.8 when hook are introduced
	- prop = this.props
	- need super()
	- managing state
		- instead useState(), initialize state in constructor this.state() , and declare a normal method where use this.setState() to update the state
	- lifecycle
		- 

ex. class component
```

```
