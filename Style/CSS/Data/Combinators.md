# Combinators

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (`space`)
- child selector (`>`)
- adjacent sibling selector (`+`)
- general sibling selector (`~`)

The _descendant_ combinator matches a child, grandchild, and so on. The _child_ combinator selects elements that are direct children of another element
