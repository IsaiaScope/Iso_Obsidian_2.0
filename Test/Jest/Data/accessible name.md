# accessible name


Whenever we try to run the get viral function, the expectation is that we are going to find exactly

one element.

So in this case, if I try to get by row with button, I'm going to find two buttons and the result

is we get an error message.

So in this particular case it says we found multiple elements with the same role.

Here are the two that have that role.

So again, get buy roll is going to give us an error if we ever find anything other than one element.

So we need to be a little bit more specific in this case.

We need to add in a little bit more of a filter criteria to this query function, and we need to say

exactly which button element we are trying to find.

One possible way to do this is by using the accessible name of an element.

So accessible name is a technical term of sorts.

The accessible name of an element is going to be the text within it.

In some cases, some elements do not have text inside of it.

For example, input elements an input.
