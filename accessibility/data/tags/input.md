_LABELS_

Inputs should be paired with labels

---

_PLACEHOLDERS_

- Placeholders are not a replacement for labels
- They should act as an additional hint, rather than presenting the same information as the label
- For example, placeholder="Date of birth" should be avoided because this information should alteady be placed in the label
- Whereas placeholder-"DD/MM/YYYY" provides an additional hint
- Or just avoid them altogether
